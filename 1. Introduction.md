# What is Python and why we should use it?

Python have a simple syntax that makes it super readable. It's an interpreted language that won't need any compilation time. Many many libraries and very big community support. Today it is used for many thing. If we go to [Python.org](https://www.python.org) in "Use Python for ..." section we can see some of python usages. Web and GUI and Software and Game and Mobile development, Scientific and Numeric computations, Machine and Deep learning, System administration, Rapid prototyping, ... the list continues!

# What is Jupyter and why we should use it?

Jupyter is a notebook that you can code within and see the result immediately. It's a good tool for experimenting python and developing small to medium scripts. You can use it for demonstrating and explaining your code to others.

# What is PyCharm and why we should use it?

PyCharm is an IDE (_Integrated Development Environment_) to write python codes. It has all good feature for an IDE, auto-completion, debugging, coloring, auto-indentation, running code, integrating with git and many more.

We use both Jupyter and PyCharm for this course. In first days we use Jupyter because it is better for first steps in learning Python. Then we switch to PyCharm to write bigger codes and maybe one or two projects.

# How to install Python, Jupyter, PyCharm?

To install Python go to [Python download page](https://www.python.org/download) and download Python 3.x and install it. In this class we talk about Python 3 and probably not python 2 at all.

To install Jupyter we first need PIP (_Python Package Index_). PIP is a Python package manager that helps installing, upgrading and removing python libraries. To install PIP go [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#installing-with-get-pip-py) and read the instruction for installation. After install PIP you should be able to install Jupyter with `pip3 install jupyter` command.

Now it's time for PyCharm. Go to [PyCharm download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/). Here you should see two different edition, community and professional. Download community edition and install it on your system.

Now we are able to start learning Python. Sit tight and go to [next part]().

    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an interpreted, general purposed language that is designed in 1991. Python can be used for object oriented and functional programming. The language usage areas are tremendous. Some of them are, system programming, graphical user interfaces, game development, developing back-end, machine learning, visualizing data, media processing, scientific programming and many many more.\n",

    "Python have very readable and simple syntax to write code. Nowadays python frameworks and libraries are every where.\n",

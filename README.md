# Python for You and Me

I am trying to create a small book about Python programming language.

## Do you need this book?

If you are:

* A teacher that wants to teach Python.
* Someone who wants to learn Python.

## How far this go?

For now, it is not so far! It is purely about python and simple scripting. But I am planning to include more and more
things in it.

## What is the goal?

I want to make book to start from almost zero knowledge and take a tour to almost every major category that Python is
used.

## How can I help?

Clone the notebook and start writing. Almost anything will help.
Thanks :)

## I'm sorry, who are you?

I'm computer engineering student that almost always code python and love AI.

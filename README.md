# Python for You and Me

I am trying to create a small book about Python programming language.

You can see a HTML version of it in your browser [here](https://733amir.github.io/python-for-you-and-me).

## Do you need this book?

If you are:

* A teacher that wants to teach Python.
* Someone who wants to learn Python.

## How far this go?

For now, it is not so far! It is purely about python and simple scripting. But I am planning to include more and more
things in it.

## What is the goal?

I want to make book to start from almost zero knowledge and take a tour to almost every major category that Python is
used.

## How can you help?

Go [here](https://zarinp.al/@amirkhazaie 'Amir Khazaie ZarinPal') and donate me as much as this book helped you. :)

Or you can clone the notebook and start editing or adding things. Then send me a pull request.

## Who am I?

I'm computer engineering student that almost always code python and love Artificial Intelligence.

If you want to contact me, my email address is `733amir@gmail.com`. You can find me on telegram with `@geamny` too.
